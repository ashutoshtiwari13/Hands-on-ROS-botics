## RANSAC plane fitting using PCL

This project uses the  [Point Cloud Library](https://pointclouds.org/) (PCL). PCL is open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing. The PCL API documentation [here](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/) , contains details of implementing many state-of-the-art algorithms using filtering , feature estimation, surface reconstruction and segmentation.

The project comprises of using the "RANdom SAmple Consensus" ([RANSAC](http://wiki.ros.org/pcl/Handbook/RANSAC)) algorithm to create point-clouds of random objects/things kept on a cluttered table.A successful implementation of the algorithm results in creating new point clouds containing the table and objects separately. The README corresponding to the project repo briefly explains the process and the filtering technique used, more can be found here - [python-pcl](https://python-pcl-fork.readthedocs.io/en/rc_patches4/tutorial/filtering.html#filtering-a-pointcloud-using-a-passthrough-filter).

## Image Segmentation using PCL
The project creates a [ROS Node](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/UnderstandingNodes) for image segmentation for objects kept on the cluttered table from the `pcd`'s used in the RANSAC plane fitting project above. The setup is run and tested on the RoboND simulator Environment provided by Udacity. The segmentation has been visualized in `Rviz` by selecting the `/pcl_objects` topic.
A successful implementation of the cluster based segmentation using [Voxel Grid filtering](https://python-pcl-fork.readthedocs.io/en/rc_patches4/tutorial/filtering.html#downsampling-a-pointcloud-using-a-voxelgrid-filter) results in assigning a different colour to each custer.

The `Gazebo` setup for the same table top consists of a stick robot with an RBG-D camera attached to its head.

## Object Recognition and Labelling
This project uses scripts and concepts from RANSAC plane fitting and Image segmentation to ultimately recognize objects on the cluttered table. A SVM classifier is trained to detect the objects kept on the cluttered table.
